title: Q10. How do I register for using the Virtual Labs?
---
As mentioned earlier, Virtual Labs are divided into two categories: simulation based labs and remote triggered labs. Registration requirements are different for the two categories.
---
* **Simulation based Labs:** All labs can be directly accessed by following the lab links on the web page.
* **Remote Triggered Labs:** To access a remote triggered lab, a user has to book a slot. For booking a slot, you have to register yourself first and then book a slot from the slot chart. All the available /booked slots can
    be viewed on this chart. Once a request for slot-booking is made, all the information regarding the user id, password and the slot booked will be sent to the userâ€™s email address provided by the user at the time of registration.
    Once registered, a user can login using the same credentials every time. This registration has to be done by the user separately for each of the remote triggered virtual labs.
