title: Q03. What are the various types of Virtual Labs?
---
There are two types of Virtual Labs:
  * **Simulation Based Virtual Labs**: In these Virtual
  Labs, the experiments are modeled using mathematical
  equations.  The simulations are carried out remotely
  at a high end server, and the results are communicated
  to the student over the internet.  This class of
  Virtual Labs, at best, mimics the real-world
  scenarios/experiments.  Simulation based Virtual Labs
  are scalable and can cater to a large number of
  simultaneous users.
  * **Remote Triggered Virtual Labs**: In these Virtual Labs, the actual
  experiments are triggered remotely.  The output of the
  experiment (being conducted remotely) is communicated
  back to the student over the internet.  This class of
  Virtual Labs, gives the student the output of
  real-time experiments.  Remote Triggered Virtual Labs
  are difficult to scale and can cater to a limited
  number of users.  Typically, time-slots are booked
  before conducting such experiments.
