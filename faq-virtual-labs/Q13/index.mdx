title: Q13. When I do an experiment how do I know if the experiment I did is done correctly?

Virtual Labs will provide to the students the result of an experiment by one of the following methods (or possibly a combination):
 * 1)Modelling the physical phenomenon by a set of equations and carrying out simulations to yield the result of the particular experiment.
 * 2)Providing a corresponding measurement data for the Virtual Lab experiment based previously carried out measurements on an actual system. 
 * 3)Remotely triggering an experiment in an actual lab and providing the student the result of the experiment through the computer interface.
