title: Q04. Who are the intended users of the Virtual Labs?
---
The intended beneficiaries of the projects are: 
  * 1)All students and Faculty Members of Science and
  Engineering Colleges who do not have access to good
  lab-facilities and/or instruments.
  * 2)High-school students, whose inquisitiveness will
  be triggered, possibly motivating them to take up
  higher-studies.
  * 3)Researchers in different institutes who can
  collaborate /share equipment and resources. 
  * 4)Different engineering colleges, who can benefit
  from the content and related teaching resources. The
  project has completely fulfilled the requirements of
  the targeted beneficiaries (and even gone
  beyond). An eco-system has evolved around Virtual
  Labs, where the community has become involved in
  evolving and benefitting from the project.
