# Become a Nodal Center

## Introduction

Virtual Labs Team organizes workshops and hands-on practice sessions in Virtual Labs (both onsite and online) for interested Science & Engineering Institutions. Training sessions are conducted for faculty members and students of institutes upon the expression of their interest in the Virtual Labs workshop.

## Purpose

The document outlines both the procedure for becoming a Nodal Centre and the steps that Nodal Center Coordinators should take when requesting an outreach workshop. Additionally, it elaborates on the roles and responsibilities of the NC and NCC, as well as the process to initiate a workshop, all of which are discussed extensively within the document.

## Target Audience
The colleges interested in participating in the Virtual Labs consortium to conduct workshops and promote virtual experiments are the target audience for this document.

## What is Nodal Center?

Colleges showing interest in conducting Virtual Labs workshops and incorporating them into their classrooms are termed Nodal Centers (NC). Their designation as an NC is valid for one year, with the possibility of renewal each year contingent on their performance in meeting the set targets. To appoint a college as an NC, the Participating Institute (PI) may organize a workshop or webinar at the college's location.


## What is the Nodal Center affiliated With?

Based on its geographical location a Nodal Center can be affiliated with any of the participating institutes (given below) of the Virtual Labs consortium.

##  What are the benefits of being a Nodal Center?
  -   Internship opportunities for students
  -   New experiment proposal/development from the respective college
  -   Recognition for NC in NAAC Accreditation.

## What are the roles and responsibilities of Nodal Center? 
  - Head of the Institution of the Nodal Centre will be responsible for the appointment of a Nodal Coordinator from their Institute.
  - The Nodal Coordinator would be required to continue with their responsibilities for at least one academic semester.
  - Requests for a change of Nodal Coordinator will not be accepted in the middle of the academic semester, except in extreme circumstances, for example when the Coordinator proceeds on leave or quits the Institute. The nomination of a new Nodal Coordinator will be accepted upon receiving confirmation from the previous Nodal Coordinator.
  - Ensuring the smooth execution of Outreach activities.
  - Promoting the adoption and usage of Virtual Labs.
  - Achieving the set targets for Virtual Labs usage.
  - Participating in meetings organized by the Principal Investigator (PI) concerning Virtual Labs.

## How to Become a Nodal Centre?

### New Enrollment of Nodal Center
-  The institute that has never been an NC before, submits the Expression of Interest (EOI) form to any of the consortium institutes and will be considered for enrollment as a new NC. Once the institute enrolled as an NC, the following will be the targets:
   -   Workshops - A minimum of 1 workshop during the one year of enrollment.
   -   Usages - A minimum usage of 8000 per year from all the workshops and other classroom use of Virtual Labs.

### Re-Enrollment of Nodal Center
-  The institute that has been an NC before can submit a fresh Expression  of Interest (EOI) form and will be considered for re-enrollment as an NC for one year.  Once the institute re-enrolled as an NC, the following will be the targets:
   -  Workshops - A minimum of 1 workshop per year during the one year of enrollment.
   -  Usages - A minimum usage of 8000 per year from all the workshops and other classroom use of Virtual Labs during enrollment. 

## Who is Nodal Center Coordinator (NCC)?

Nodal Center Coordinator (NCC) will be nominated from each NC by the head of the institute. The NCC will submit all the reports periodically to the Virtual Labs team of the respective institute. 

## What are the responsibilities of Nodal Center Coordinator?
- The Nodal Center Coordinator (NCC) will be the main interface between the Outreach Team of Virtual Labs, IIIT Hyderabad, and the Nodal Centre.
- He/She will conduct training sessions for students and faculty members in his/her Institute.
- NC may take help from other faculty members and support staff to coordinate training programs in their respective institutes.
- A monthly progress report regarding Virtual Labs usage by the students must be submitted by the Nodal Coordinator to the IIIT Hyderabad, duly signed by the Director/Principal of the Institute.
- NCs will coordinate workshops. If required, the Outreach team from IIIT Hyderabad may be invited.
- The number of lab usage is expected to be greater than 8000 per year.
- There is no financial commitment from Virtual Labs for the Nodal Center activity.
- The Nodal Coordinator should submit a report of each workshop conducted, with relevant photographs. A template for the report will be shared by IIIT Hyderabad.
