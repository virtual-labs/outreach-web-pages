# Become a Nodal Center

## Introduction

Virtual Labs Team organizes workshops and hands-on practice sessions in Virtual Labs (both onsite and online) for interested Science & Engineering Institutions. Training sessions are conducted for faculty members and students of institutes upon the expression of their interest in the Virtual Labs workshop.

## Purpose

The document outlines both the procedure for becoming a Nodal Centre and the steps that Nodal Center Coordinators should take when requesting an outreach workshop. Additionally, it elaborates on the roles and responsibilities of the NC and NCC, as well as the process to initiate a workshop, all of which are discussed extensively within the document.

## Target Audience
The colleges interested in participating in the Virtual Labs consortium to conduct workshops and promote virtual experiments are the target audience for this document.

## What is Nodal Center?

Colleges showing interest in conducting Virtual Labs workshops and incorporating them into their classrooms are termed Nodal Centers (NC). Their designation as an NC is valid for one year, with the possibility of renewal each year contingent on their performance in meeting the set targets. To appoint a college as an NC, the Participating Institute (PI) may organize a workshop or webinar at the college's location.


## What is the Nodal Center affiliated With?

Based on its geographical location a Nodal Center can be affiliated with any of the participating institutes (given below) of the Virtual Labs consortium.

##  What are the benefits of being a Nodal Center?
  -   Internship opportunities for students
  -   New experiment proposal/development from the respective college
  -   Recognition for NC in NAAC Accreditation.

## What are the roles and responsibilities of the Nodal Center? 
  - The head of the Institution of the Nodal Centre will be responsible for the appointment of a Nodal Coordinator from their Institute.
  - The Nodal Coordinator would be required to continue with their responsibilities for at least one academic semester.
  - Requests for a change of Nodal Coordinator will not be accepted in the middle of the academic semester, except in extreme circumstances, for example when the Coordinator proceeds on leave or quits the Institute. The nomination of a new Nodal Coordinator will be accepted upon receiving confirmation from the previous Nodal Coordinator.
  - Nodal Center should ensure the smooth execution of Outreach activities and promote the usage of Virtual Labs.
  - The Nodal Center must accomplish the established targets for the utilization of Virtual Labs.
  - Participating in meetings organized by the Principal Investigator (PI) concerning Virtual Labs.

## How to Become a Nodal Centre?

### New Enrollment of Nodal Center
-  The institute that has never been an NC before, submits the Expression of Interest (EOI) form to any of the consortium institutes and will be considered for enrollment as a new NC. Once the institute enrolled as an NC, the following will be the targets:
   -   [Workshops](https://github.com/virtual-labs/outreach-web-pages-iiith/edit/main/nodal-centre-process/nodal-centre-process.md#workshop) - A minimum of 1 workshop during the one year of enrollment.
   -   [Usages](https://github.com/virtual-labs/outreach-web-pages-iiith/edit/main/nodal-centre-process/nodal-centre-process.md#usage) - A minimum usage of 8000 per year from all the workshops and other classroom use of Virtual Labs.

### Re-Enrollment of Nodal Center
-  The institute that has been an NC before can submit a fresh Expression  of Interest (EOI) form and will be considered for re-enrollment as an NC for one year.  Once the institute re-enrolled as an NC, the following will be the targets:
   -  [Workshops](https://github.com/virtual-labs/outreach-web-pages-iiith/edit/main/nodal-centre-process/nodal-centre-process.md#workshop)  - A minimum of 1 workshop per year during the one year of enrollment.
   -  [Usages](https://github.com/virtual-labs/outreach-web-pages-iiith/edit/main/nodal-centre-process/nodal-centre-process.md#usage) - A minimum usage of 8000 per year from all the workshops and other classroom use of Virtual Labs during enrollment. 

## Who is Nodal Center Coordinator (NCC)?

Nodal Center Coordinator (NCC) will be nominated from each NC by the head of the institute. The NCC will submit all the reports periodically to the Virtual Labs team of the respective institute. 

## What are the responsibilities of the Nodal Center Coordinator?
- The Nodal Center Coordinator (NCC) shall serve as the primary liaison between the Outreach Team of Virtual Labs, the Participating Institute, and the Nodal Centre.
- The NCC will be responsible for organizing training sessions for students and faculty members within their respective Institute.
- The NCC may seek assistance from other faculty members and support staff to effectively coordinate training programs within their Institute.
- On a monthly basis, the NCC must submit a progress report on the usage of Virtual Labs by the students to the Participating Institute,. The report should bear the signature of the Institute's Director/Principal.
- The NCC will be in charge of coordinating workshops, and if necessary, they may extend an invitation to the Outreach team from the Participating Institute.
- It is expected that the annual lab usage will exceed 8000.
- The Nodal Center activity does not involve any financial commitment from Virtual Labs.
- After conducting each workshop, the NC must submit a comprehensive report, including relevant photographs. The Participating Institute will provide a template for the report.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming a Nodal Center
- Initiate contact with any of the consortium institutions that you are interested in for potential collaboration.
- Submit an [expression of interest](http://38.100.110.143/EOI-2023.pdf) document, duly completed and signed by the head of your institute, to the chosen consortium institution.
- Approach the Principal Investigator (PI) to discuss the possibility of conducting a workshop at your institute's premises.
- Anticipate the contact of the Virtual Labs Outreach Team within a period of 5-10 business days. Subsequent communication shall be conducted via email.
- The mode ([online](https://github.com/virtual-labs/outreach-web-pages-iiith/blob/main/workshop-process/workshop-process.md#requirements-for-online-workshop) or [onsite](https://github.com/virtual-labs/outreach-web-pages-iiith/blob/main/workshop-process/workshop-process.md#requirements-for-onsite-version) for the workshop shall be determined through mutual agreement on a suitable date.
- Following the completion of the online or onsite workshop, the necessary documents([online](https://github.com/virtual-labs/outreach-web-pages-iiith/blob/main/workshop-process/workshop-process.md#documents-to-be-submitted-for-online-workshop)/[onsite](https://github.com/virtual-labs/outreach-web-pages-iiith/blob/main/workshop-process/workshop-process.md#documents-to-be-submitted-for-onsite-workshop) related to the workshop's execution should be submitted to the PI.
- Once the workshop-related documentation has been submitted and reviewed, an Appointment letter will be issued to your Nodal center as appropriate.

## What is the agenda of the workshop?
The agenda for the workshops that we propose to conduct at your college on mutually convenient dates will be as follows.

- A Brief Overview of the Virtual Labs (10-15 minutes) by the Virtual Labs Team.
- Demo of one experiment  (15-20 minutes) by the Virtual Labs Team.
- Performance of Experiments  (45-50 minutes) by students.
- Simultaneous filling of feedback forms by students.

## Definitions
### Usage
A single usage consists of a student or faculty member doing a Virtual Labsâ€™ experiment through a workshop or in regular classroom use. The faculty member for holding workshop is responsible for certifying that a student has done the experiment. As part of attending a workshop, a student will submit a feedback form which lists the number of experiments that the student has done in that workshop.

### Workshop
A single workshop lasts for at least 2.5 hours (150 minutes) duration. Each workshop has a 25-minute introduction followed by a demo session of 25 minutes and a student takes 20 minutes to do an experiment, then each student likely to do about 5 experiments in one workshop session. With 30 persons, this turns out to be 30 x 5 = 150 usages in a typical workshop. The NCs are encouraged to depend not only on workshops but also on classroom use to meet the semester usage targets.
